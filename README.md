# Telegram Forwarding

Run the script by double clicking on `run.bat`.

You will be asked for a API ID and API Hash. You can get those values by registering a application at [https://my.telegram.org/](https://my.telegram.org/). You have to log in with your phone number and then go to ['API development tools'](https://my.telegram.org/apps). You can register some app here and get the API ID and Hash. 

Alternatively you can add the run.bat file with and editor of your choice and add
`--api_id=<YOUR-API_ID> --api_hash=<YOUR-API_HASH>` and optionally also your phone number `--phone=<YOUR-PHONE-NUMBER>`
