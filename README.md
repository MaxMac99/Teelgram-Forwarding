# Telegram Forwarding

Run the script by double clicking on `run.bat`.

You will be asked for a API ID and API Hash. You can get those values by registering a application at [https://my.telegram.org/](https://my.telegram.org/). You have to log in with your phone number and then go to ['API development tools'](https://my.telegram.org/apps). You can register some app here and get the API ID and Hash.

Alternatively you can add the run.bat file with and editor of your choice and change the parameters in the brackets of `<API_ID>`, `<API_HASH>` and `<PHONE_NUMBER>` to the phone number you are logged in with in telegram.
