# Telegram Forwarding

You will be asked for a API ID and API Hash. You can get those values by registering a application at [https://my.telegram.org/](https://my.telegram.org/). You have to log in with your phone number and then go to ['API development tools'](https://my.telegram.org/apps). You can register some app here and get the API ID and Hash.

## Docker

You can start the service by running `docker-compose run telegramforwarding`.
Then you have the interactive window for the first start.
When everything is set up, you can start with `docker-compose up -d`
